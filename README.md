# javaSimpleSynth

A straightforward Java application for playing MIDI files using custom soundfonts. This minimalistic code provides an uncomplicated solution for anyone seeking a simple MIDI player to integrate into their own project.

## Getting Started:

 1. Provide Soundfont and MIDI Files: Place your custom soundfont and MIDI file in the same directory as the `javaSimpleSynth.java` file.

 2. Replace Placeholder Paths: Open `javaSimpleSynth.java` and replace the following placeholders with the actual filenames of your soundfont and MIDI file: `path_to_soundfont.sf2` and `path_to_midi_file.mid`.

**Enjoy!**

The program will play the specified MIDI file using the provided custom soundfont. Make sure the soundfont and MIDI file paths are correctly replaced in the code.

**Note**: This program requires a valid soundfont to play MIDI files. It won't work with the default soundfont.
